"# JokeLibrary" 
This is a simple joke catalog.  It's not complete yet but the front end functionality is there.  I still need to create a joke object ideally interacting with an API to populate the pages.  Hopefully I can find an API that has access to both joke and punchline so I'll be able to render it appropriately.
